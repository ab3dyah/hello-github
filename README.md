## Introduction!
**My name is Abed Dikko**


This is my first repository in github showing a little python code that prints a simple greeting using a function.

Feel free to commit and submit a pull request (that's all it is about on github right? Colaborations  ðŸ¤—)

Let's be world class shall we?
